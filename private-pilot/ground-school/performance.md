# Performance

## Aircraft Performance

### Hydroplaning

speed = 9 x sqrt of tire PSI
(example, if tire pressure is 36 psi, sqrt is 6, 9x6=54knots for hydroplaning speed)

### Climb Performance

* weight has a pronounced effect on climb performance

More Weight > More Life (angle of attack) > more drag = more thrust > less reserve thrust for climbing

* reserve thrust is the additional thrust available beyond straight and level flights. 

* absolute ceiling. no more escess power. zero reight of climb. 
* service ceiling. climbing at 100fpm. 

### Range & Endurance

* converting fuel into range (nautical miles) and endurance (minutes). 
  * range is impacted by wind
  * endurance is maximum when fuel flow is minimal flow. 
  
### Region of reversed command

least amount of power for best possible speed us fhe best indurance. 

being slower than this we need more power as we get slower. this is the area of reversed command. is critical during slow flight to increase the throttle the slower you fly and the higher angle of attack which increases the drag. 

### factors which affect performance

* pressure - higher is better
* temperature - lower is better
* humidity - lower is better

**Performance charts are created with brand new plans with test pilots on a well maintained runway**

airport impact:
* runway smoothness: less smooth increases groundroll. 
* wet or grass: reduced braking. 
* charts contain deviation for grass or wet surface.
